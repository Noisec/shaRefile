# shaRefile
An file host tool
How I recommend to use it:

> Go to your router settings and make port forwarding to 8080
Turn off your firewall
Register to no-ip, make an hostname, download no-ip DUC and apply the hostname.
MAKE AN HOST.TXT file containing the host you made or just your ip
MAKE AN PATH.TXT file containing the path you want to share (following with /)
Launch the executable or the python script

From now, put any file in the folder you set, and you can just access it with <hostname>:8080/<filename>

> You can use this to host images, files or anything you want
