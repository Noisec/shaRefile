# shaRefile
An file host tool

How I recommend to use it:

> Go to your router settings and make port forwarding to 8080

> Turn off your firewall

> Register to no-ip, make an hostname, download no-ip DUC and apply the hostname.

> MAKE AN HOST.TXT file containing the host you made or just your ip

> MAKE AN PATH.TXT file containing the path you want to share (following with /)

> Launch the executable or the python script

From now, put any file in the folder you set, and you can just access it with <hostname>:8080/<filename>

> You can use this to host images, files or anything you want
